<h3><span style="font-size: 24px;">Smart-Shop Robbery Suspect Caught</span></h3><p></p><h5><span style="font-size: 24px;">Drug-Related Crime on the Rise in Jefferson</span></h5>By Petra Suric<br><p></p>

<p>JEFFERSON TOWNSHIP - On Monday police arrested a man suspected of robbing the Smart-Shop grocery store of $125.&nbsp; The arrest came less than six hours after Esther Hong, the owner of the Smart-Shop store, reported the robbery.</p><p>The suspect, Chris Jackson, was found just a few blocks from the store and he put up no resistance when police arrested him. He was apparently high on drugs he had purchased with some of the money taken from the store.</p><p>Ms. Hong told reporters that Mr. Jackson came into the store just after it opened and demanded all the money from the cash register. He threatened the owner with a knife, and Ms. Hong gave him all the cash she had.&nbsp; The suspect&nbsp; fled, and Ms. Hong called the police.</p><p>A few hours later police responded to a telephone complaint and found Mr. Jackson in an alley a few blocks from the store.&nbsp; e arresting officer said he appeared to be stoned and did not attempt to evade arrest.&nbsp; The officers found a syringe and other drug paraphernalia in Jackson’s pocket. He was charged with armed robbery and possession of drugs.</p><p>&nbsp;This is the&nbsp; &nbsp;fifteenth drug related arrest in Jefferson this month, and the police are calling it an epidemic. Sergeant Heather Kugelmass said “Drugs are now the number one law enforcement problem in Jefferson. Half of our arrests involve drugs.”</p><p>Mayor Stone has called for more money to hire more police officers to reduce the growing crime rate in Jefferson. But the Council is divided on what to do.</p><p>City Council members Alex Nemeth and LeighAnn Rodd called a press conference to demand that the rest of the council support an increase in the police budget. “If we put more cops on the street,” they said, “we will show that criminals are not welcome in Jefferson.”</p><p>Mayoral candidate Dr. Jamie Eager called for a different approach. “More police won’t make a difference, we need more drug treatment programs,” Eager said. “The problem is not crime, per se, but crimes committed by drug users to feed their habits. Treat the drug use, and the crime will go away.”</p><p>&nbsp;The Council is slated to debate the proposed budget increase for police at its next meeting.</p>
